#Athena

Athena is our weaver. This is her source file. 

As we are writing a weaver, it happens that we do not have one. This file must perforce be hand woven until Athena may take over. Asking a Goddess to take over any process should, and shall not, be done casually. 

Athena is written in [Git Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown), a format designed around code sharing. The executable parts are written in [Clojure](http://clojure.org), using the [Instaparse](https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse) parsing library. 
#Hymn

Hail, fleet footed Hermes, beloved of Athena!

Hail, Pallas Athene! Hear the ancient words:

    I begin to sing of Pallas Athena, the glorious Goddess, bright-eyed,  
    inventive, unbending of heart,  
    pure virgin, saviour of cities,  
    courageous, Tritogeneia. Wise Zeus himself bare her  
    from his awful head, arrayed in warlike arms  
    of flashing gold, and awe seized all the gods as they gazed.  
    But Athena sprang quickly from the immortal head 
    and stood before Zeus who holds the aegis,  
    shaxing a sharp spear: great Olympus began to reel horribly 
    at the might of the bright-eyed Goddess, 
    and earth round about cried fearfully,  
    and the sea was moved and tossed with dark waves,  
    while foam burst forth suddenly:  
    the bright Son of Hyperion stopped his swift-footed horses a long while, 
          until the maiden Pallas Athena had stripped the heavenly armour 
          from her immortal shoulders.  
    And wise Zeus was glad. 

And so hail to you, daughter of Zeus who holds the aegis!  
Now I will remember you and another song as well.
