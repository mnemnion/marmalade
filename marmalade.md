#Marmalade

Marmalade is a literate programming environment. It is written in Marmalade, using Clojure as the interpretation environment and [metacircular](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-circular_evaluator) bootstrap. 

Marmalade is a dialect of Git-Flavored Markdown. As such, Marmalade may be written in [many languages](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml) while still being written in Marmalade. I chose Clojure out of familiarity, and because Instaparse is fun to work with. 

Literate programming is due for a revival. Any program running in the browser contains at least three languages, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Often, these are actually generated by template languages and JS-targeting compilers, further muddying the waters.

On the server side, even a simple application often has at least three languages involved, before we start to count binaries that are used alongside the custom logic. A Ruby core, some Python string handling, a bit of Java for the database layer, perhaps some Clojure, a crypto layer written in some flavor of C, and it goes on: there are the configuration languages and shell scripts to be considered. 

There are no real best practices for keeping this all in a canonical form that is reference, documentation, rationale, bibliography and source, all in one package. Hence, a Git-Flavored literary Markdown project.
