##The Marmalade Macro System

What makes literate programming distinctive is not the interleaving of documentation and code. That's a weaker paradigm, frequently reinvented. Two variations: one is embedding documentation in comments or strings in the code, the other is embedding code in a comment syntax and extracting it. The former is Javadoc, doc strings in Python/Clojure/Common Lisp/YouNameIt; the latter is used in Literate Coffeescript, which is not true literate programming, albeit an improvement over nothing at all.
