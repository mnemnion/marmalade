#Bar

This is the bar file.

Foo links to it. Not much else going on here.

>####  file: ../toytangle/src/core.clj

```clojure

{:bar "from the bar file"}

#|(baz)|#

#|(bux)|#

```

>#### source:   bux

```clojure

{:bux "this is from the bux block of the bar file"}

```


Doesn't that feel nice? Sure it does.
